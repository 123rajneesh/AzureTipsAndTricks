```powershell
$a = Get-AzureRmLog -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> | Where-Object { $_.operationname.value -contains "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/slotsswap/action" -and $_.Status.Value -eq 'Succeeded'} 
$a | select { $_.eventtimestamp,$_.operationname.value,$_.status.value,$_.resourceid.substring(50) }
```
