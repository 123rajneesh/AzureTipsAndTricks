#### Modifying an existing API Connection with Azure Logic App

If you have created an Azure Logic App, and have an existing API Connection that you would like to modify, then you can do so very easily. Go ahead and open your logic app and look under **Development Tools** then **API Connections** and you'll see a list of API connections associated with the logic app.

Under **General**, you'll see **Edit API Connection**.

Now you can edit the API information and then press **Authorize** to change the API connection associated with your Logic App.
