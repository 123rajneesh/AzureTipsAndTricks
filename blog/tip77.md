## Working with Azure Storage Explorer

This week we've reviewed the following options with Azure Storage :

* [Working with Azure Storage Blobs and Files through the Portal](http://www.michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks74/)
* [Create an Azure Storage Blob Container through C#](http://www.michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks75/)
* [Uploading and Downloading a Stream into an Azure Storage Blob](http://www.michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks76/)

While it has been easy working with Azure Storage through the Portal and C#, one gem that I haven't covered was Azure Storage Explorer. In this post, we'll take a look at it. 

**What is it?** [Azure Storage Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) allows you to easily manage the contents of your storage account. It comes complete with features such as: upload, download, and manage blobs, files, queues, tables, and Cosmos DB entities.

## How I typically work with Azure Storage Explorer

After downloading the tool, I typically begin with the option **Use a connection string or a shared access signature URI** as shown below.

I then switch over to my Azure Storage account that I want to work with and look under **Settings**, then **Access Keys** and copy the connection string to my clipboard.

I paste that into Azure Storage Explorer and now have access to my data.

Now, I can do things such for my table storage such as CRUD operations as well as querying.
