#### Quickly edit files within Cloud Shell using Code

I recently had a reader that read my **Cloud Shell** list of [Azure Tips and Tricks](tip-sorted-list/) and noticed that I didn't mention using Code with Cloud Shell. Today's tip is to make that right!

I'm sure by now everyone has used the lovely [Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in some application before but may not be aware that you use the editor within Cloud Shell without installing anything. To give this a spin, then open up Cloud Shell and type ``code .`` and you'll see the following:

Notice that you can do things such as navigate directories, view files with the same syntax used in VS Code and you can easily save, close the editor or open a file outside the current working directory and open the command pallete. 

If you open the command pallete then you'll see a very familiar list of commands that you've probably used in the editor on your desktop.
