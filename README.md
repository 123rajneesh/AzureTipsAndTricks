# Welcome

When I reflect back on Azure Tips and Tricks a year ago, I was only thinking that I’d write a couple of posts and move on. Fast-forward to today, the collection has grown to over 170+ tips, as well as videos, conference talks, and 2 eBooks that span the entire universe of the Azure platform. What you are currently reading is a special collection of tips based on real-world scenarios that I've encountered while using Azure on a daily basis. I’ve grouped the tips by categories and added a search bar so you can find what you are looking for quickly.
